			<ul id="time-line">
		
				  <li><strong>December 1901</strong> - Born in Chicago, Illinois. He was the fourth son of Elias and Flora Disney. His siblings were, Herbert, Raymond, Roy, and his sister Ruth.</li><br>
				  
				  <li> <strong>July 1923</strong> - He moved to Hollywood, California and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy.</li><br>
				  
				  <li><strong>October 1923</strong> - Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studio—which later became The Walt Disney Company—to produce the films.</li><br>
				  
				  <li><strong>July 1925</strong> - Disney married Lillian Bounds, at her brother's house in her hometown of Lewiston, Idaho.  Their marriage produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously).</li><br>
				  
				  <li><strong>1950–1966</strong> - from the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.<BR>
					•	For several years Disney had been considering building a theme park. When he visited Griffith Park in Los Angeles with his daughters, he wanted to be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and their parents could have fun. </li><br>
					
				  <li><strong>March 1952</strong> - Disney received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the Disney studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in Anaheim, 35 miles (56 km) south of the studio, was purchased. To distance the project from the studio—which might attract the criticism of shareholders—Disney formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) and used his own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans;  those involved became known as "Imagineers".</li><br>
				  
				  <li><strong>November 1966 </strong> - Disney had been a heavy smoker since World War I. He did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy.</li><br>
					
				  <li><strong>November 30 </strong> - Disney felt unwell and was taken to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, ten days after his 65th birthday, he died of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer.  Disney's remains were cremated two days later and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.</li>

				“He had supreme confidence that he would know what the public wanted. And he was right 98 percent of time. He had a tremendous ability to pay attention to every little detail, and yet know the overall picture as well.”
